        self.spots.append(spot)
# # pay rate

#function for capacity 

# total_spot = Gargage(20)

# - This should decrease the amount of parkingSpaces available by 1

# - payForParking
# - Display an input that waits for an amount from the user and store it in a variable


# - If the payment variable is not empty then 
 # (meaning the ticket has been paid) -> 
# display a message to the user that their ticket has been paid and they have 15mins to leave
        

# - This should update the "currentTicket" dictionary key "paid" to True
# -leaveGarage
# - If the ticket has been paid, display a message of "Thank You, have a nice day"
# - If the ticket has not been paid, display an input prompt for payment
# - Once paid, display message "Thank you, have a nice day!"
# - Update parkingSpaces list to increase by 1 (meaning add to the parkingSpaces list)
# - Update tickets list to increase by 1 (meaning add to the tickets list)

# You will need a few attributes as well:
# - tickets -> list
# - parkingSpaces -> list
# - currentTicket -> dictionary
